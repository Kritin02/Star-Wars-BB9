## Abstract
*The droid should replicate BB-8 from the Star Wars franchise complete with a rotating body but a stationary head.The movement of the droid can be controlled by a companion app. The body can rotate freely and can be moved in all direction freely using the app.The head is established by using strong Neodymium magnets and ball casters.* 


## Motivation
*After watching the BB-8 from Star Wars, we were interested in its working and mechanism. As the newbies, out of curiosity we choose to work on the same.*

## Applications
*Potential applications of BB9 are many. To list the few:*
* Could be used to guide people along the desired path or in a maze. 
* BB9 can be used in to read number plate of moving vehicles.

## Limitations
* Delay in complex movements during motion.
* Due to use of Neodymium magnets, the head may not be perfectly stable.
* Could not be controlled outside device's bluetooth range.
* Uneven shape of globe will result in uneven motion of bot.

## Future Improvement
* Could use camera on the head for survelliance.
* Providing more sensors to prevent collision.
* Use of PID, to improve the movement of the bot.
* Could use advancedment in app to move the bot in desired shapes.
* Use of GPS instead, to increase movement precision and to reach their destination.
